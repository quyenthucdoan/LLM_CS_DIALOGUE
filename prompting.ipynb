It's beautifully filmed. It was filmed, I think in over 20 countries. It was filmed by a director called Tarsem Singh, if I say his name right. And I believe he financed most of it. It was sort of his pet project, and I like the story. But it's just beautifully\\nUSER: A particular movie, I can't think off the top of my head, but in general I'm not a huge fan of comedies. Well, actually I can think of one.

It wasn't terrible or anything. I like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. It got a little boring in parts. If I was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, I would've picked Interstellar. I think it had a better story and more meaning. And just was more interesting\\nUSER: Although, I believe the motion was more to the book and not necessarily I wouldn't say to the book, but to how it would surely be to be stuck up on more by yourself eventually.\\nSYSTEM: Wonderful. thank you for sharing.

So Sci-Fi is a is a great genre for me, and I like a occasional comedy something like from Adam Sandler or some other comedian.\\nSYSTEM: adam sandler, ok which movie you like with him in it\\nUSER: My favorite Adam Sandler movie is The Waterboy. And I don't like his newer stuff, but definitely his older stuff from the mid 2000s is is is all good.\\nSYSTEM: the waterboy, any particular scene you remember\\nUSER: Yes, any scene with Rob Schneider in it in The Waterboy. I just love it.\\nSYSTEM: ok so what is the differences between adam's newer movies to his older ones\\nUSER: His newer movies lack the comedic output as his older ones. His older ones have almost all original ideas, and his newer ones are seems like it's more made for, you know, like a family environment, like a family comedy rather than, you know, adult comedy. Or just stupid stupid comedy, so\\nSYSTEM: ah ok, so its more family oriented now, do you think he lost his touch?\\nUSER: Well, he's still funny. He's just not as funny as he used to be. So, he might have lost a little bit of it, but still he's movies is still entertaining, but just not as much as so.\\nSYSTEM: gotcha, so he is still a good comedian ,what about other movies you enjoy\\nSYSTEM: thats not funny\\nUSER: I like the Sci-Fi movie called Event Horizon.\\nUSER: If I had a choice between any movie I want, I would probably pick a sci-fi movie like Event Horizon or one of the newer Star Trek movies.\\nSYSTEM: ah ok, cool. lets talk about movies you dont like\\nUSER: Okay. I don't like romance, and I don't like period-style pieces either, or history related movies.\\nSYSTEM: ok would you go watch lets say the notebook if someone invited you\\nUSER: No, I wouldn't.\\nSYSTEM: why not\\nUSER: Because it's a waste of time.\\nSYSTEM: what is it about romance movie you find waste of time\\nUSER: They're boring. There's no action in them. And their stories are pretty repetitive.\\nSYSTEM: would you be ok with romantic elements in movies like star trek or star wars?\\nUSER: No, I think those scenes are also a waste of time.\\nSYSTEM: gotcha, so what scenes you think worth the time and money\\nUSER: Well, like I said, it non-romance scenes is is worth the time and money. Like any scene that, you know, actively moves the story along rather than, you know, normal scenes that just are there just to waste time.\\nSYSTEM: ok any scenes that are active and comical is fine\\nSYSTEM: is that right\\nUSER: Yeah.\\n\"},\n",

And just puts you in a good mood, and that's how I would prefer to be.\\nSYSTEM: got it, can you name a specific movie you really liked?\\nUSER: Sure, Best in Show is one of my absolute favorites.\\nSYSTEM: ok, why do you like that movie?\\nUSER: Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed.\\nUSER: It's just hilarious. It's so original.\\nUSER: So much, so different, and just so funny. It makes you laugh every time you watch it.\\nSYSTEM: ok, would you say you enjoy satire?\\nUSER: Yeah.\\nSYSTEM: ok, can you name a film you dislike?\\nUSER: Sure, Bounty Hunter.\\nSYSTEM: why didn't you like that movie?\\nUSER: It was supposed to be a comedy, and not only was it not funny, it was confusing what they were going for. I think it was miscast.\\nUSER: It's Jennifer Aniston and I can't even think of his name, but somebody who I don't really care for. But I do like Jennifer usually, and it wasn't a good fit for her. Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny.\\nUSER: It kind of had like a more dramatic feel to it because it wasn't funny. It was just It was odd. Really.\\nSYSTEM: was the acting bad?\\nUSER: It wasn't great. It was not great.\\nSYSTEM: ok, can you tell me have you watched the movie the shawshank redemption?\\nUSER: Oh, yes.\\nSYSTEM: do you like that movie?\\nUSER: It's a excellent movie.\\nSYSTEM: ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?\\nUSER: It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better.\\nUSER: It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film.\\nUSER: with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar.\\n\""
