SYSTEM: Do you like movies like Star Wars?
[Intent: ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES]

USER: I love Star Wars. I even like the new ones. I don't care what anybody says. The Last Jedi was pretty good, and the one before it was even even better. And I even like the Han Solo story, although it was kind of slow but I'll tell you, the one that was really good to me was the the Rogue One. I really really enjoyed that one. I can't wait till the next one comes out.

[Intent: ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES]

USER: Yeah, I like Star Trek. I recently watched went back and watched all the different TV series and then went and watched all the different TV or all the different movies. And I'm not a super big fun of the first ones although the movies for the first ones were probably the best of the series, but I'm not a big fun of the first series. I try to watch it, re-watch it there's the first 3 seasons, and it was hard it was hard to get through it just because that is the acting's so bad
[Intent: ENTITY_NAME+MOVIE_OR_SERIES | Scores: 3,3,4]

USER: and the stars were so bad, but I like all the movies. The movies I haven't found a movie I didn't like in the Star Wars series. Although there was that one that was not quite as good as the rest, but Star Trek's good. I could go for another Star Trek movie.
